# Containerize Multi-container JavaScript application

## Run the Database Server

We will use postgres official image since we only need simple image to demonstrate.

To run this database server image, execute this command:

```bash
docker container run \
    --detach \
    --name=notes-db \
    --env POSTGRES_DB=notesdb \
    --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
    --network=notes-api-network \
    postgres:12

# a7b287d34d96c8e81a63949c57b83d7c1d71b5660c87f5172f074bd1606196dc

docker container ls

# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS      NAMES
# a7b287d34d96   postgres:12   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About
```

The `--env` option for the `container run` and `container create` commands can be used for providing environment variables to a container.

But databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL persist their data in a directory. **If container is destroy, we'll lose all our data.**

To solve this problem, a named volume can be used.

## Work with named volume

The volume create command can be used for creating a named volume.

```bash
docker volume create <volume name>
```

To create a volume named `notes-db-data`, we can execute the following command:

```bash
docker volume create notes-db-data

# notes-db-data

docker volume ls

# DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
# local     notes-db-data
```

To stop and remove the `notes-db` container:

```bash
docker container stop notes-db

# notes-db

docker container rm notes-db

# notes-db
```

Now run a new container and assign the volume using the `--volume` or `-v` option.

```bash
docker container run \
    --detach \
    --volume notes-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    --name=notes-db \
    --env POSTGRES_DB=notesdb \
    --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
    --network=notes-api-network \
    postgres:12

# 37755e86d62794ed3e67c19d0cd1eba431e26ab56099b92a3456908c1d346791
```

Now we can inspect the `notes-db` container to make sure that the mounting was successful:

```bash
docker container inspect --format='{{range .Mounts}} {{ .Name }} {{end}}' notes-db

#  notes-db-data
```

## Access logs from a Container

In order to see the logs from a container, we can use the `container logs` command.

```bash
docker container logs <container identifier>
```

To access the logs from the notes-db container, you can execute the following command:

```bash
docker container logs notes-db
# The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
# This user must also own the server process.

# The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
# The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
# The default text search configuration will be set to "english".
#
# Data page checksums are disabled.
#
# fixing permissions on existing directory /var/lib/postgresql/data ... ok
# creating subdirectories ... ok
# selecting dynamic shared memory implementation ... posix
# selecting default max_connections ... 100
# selecting default shared_buffers ... 128MB
# selecting default time zone ... Etc/UTC
# creating configuration files ... ok
# running bootstrap script ... ok
# performing post-bootstrap initialization ... ok
# syncing data to disk ... ok
#
#
# Success. You can now start the database server using:
#
#     pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -l logfile start
#
# initdb: warning: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
# You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
# --auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

```

The `--follow` or `-f` option for the command which lets you attach the console to the logs output and get a continuous stream of text.

## Create a Network and Attaching the Database Server

First, create a network named `notes-api-network` in our system:

```bash
docker network create notes-api-network
```

Now attach the `notes-db` container to this network by executing the following command:

```bash
docker network connect notes-api-network notes-db
```

## Write the Dockerfile

```bash
# stage one
FROM node:lts-alpine as builder

# install dependencies for node-gyp
RUN apk add --no-cache python make g++

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./package.json .
RUN npm install --only=prod

# stage two
FROM node:lts-alpine

EXPOSE 3000
ENV NODE_ENV=production

USER node
RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app
WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY . .
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules  /home/node/app/node_modules

CMD [ "node", "bin/www" ]
```

This is a multi-staged build.

The first stage is used for building and installing the dependencies using node-gyp and the second stage is for running the application.

To build an image from this Dockerfile, we can execute the following command:

```bash
docker image build --tag notes-api .

# Sending build context to Docker daemon  37.38kB

### LONG INSTALLATION STUFF GOES HERE ###

# Successfully built 9ea100571585
# Successfully tagged notes-api:latest
```

To make sure the database container is running, and is attached to the `notes-api-network`, run:

```bash
docker container inspect notes-db

#         }
#     }
# ]
```

We can run a new container by executing the following command:

```bash
docker container run \
    --detach \
    --name=notes-api \
    --env DB_HOST=notes-db \
    --env DB_DATABASE=notesdb \
    --env DB_PASSWORD=secret \
    --publish=3000:3000 \
    --network=notes-api-network \
    notes-api

# f9ece420872de99a060b954e3c236cbb1e23d468feffa7fed1e06985d99fb919
```

To check if the container is running properly or not, you can use the `container ls` command:

```bash
docker container ls

# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
# f9ece420872d   notes-api     "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   12 minutes ago   Up 12 minutes   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   notes-api
# 37755e86d627   postgres:12   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   17 hours ago     Up 14 minutes   5432/tcp                 notes-db
```

## Execute commands in a running Container

We'll have to run the database migration necessary for setting up the database tables before using this container.

Use the `exec` command to execute a custom command inside a running container.

```bash
docker container exec <container identifier> <command>
```

To execute npm run db:migrate inside the notes-api container, you can execute the following command:

```bash
docker container exec notes-api npm run db:migrate

# > notes-api@ db:migrate /home/node/app
# > knex migrate:latest
#
# Using environment: production
# Batch 1 run: 1 migrations
```

When we want to run an interactive command inside a running container, we'll have to use the `-it` flag

```bash
docker container exec -it notes-api sh

# / # uname -a
# Linux b5b1367d6b31 5.10.9-201.fc33.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Jan 20 16:56:23 UTC 2021 x86_64 Linux
```
