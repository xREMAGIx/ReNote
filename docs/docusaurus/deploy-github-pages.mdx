# Deploy to GitHub Pages

:::info

From my experience deploy this site (Docusaurus v3) to GitHub Pages, I will note some steps here.

For more information, please reference to official link: [Docusaurus-Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages)

:::

### docusaurus.config.js settings

First, modify your docusaurus.config.js and changes the following params:

- **url**: your github pages url
- **baseUrl**: your github pages repo name
- **projectName**: your github pages repo name
- **organizationName**: your github username

:::warning

GitHub Pages adds a trailing slash to Docusaurus URLs by default. It is recommended to set a trailingSlash config (true or false, not undefined).

:::

For example:

```js
export default {
  // ...
  url: "https://xremagix.github.io",
  baseUrl: "/renote/",
  projectName: "renote",
  organizationName: "xREMAGIx",
  trailingSlash: false,
  // ...
};
```

### Deploy

:::note

By default, Docusaurus uses HTTPS to deploy to GitHub Pages. Since Github change from password to **personal access token (PAT)**, you need to create a personal access token and use it as password when deploy.
More information: [GitHub-Create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

So for convinience, I use SSH to deploy to GitHub Pages. By setting `USE_SSH=true`, Docusaurus will use SSH to deploy.

:::

```bash
GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

For example:

```bash
GIT_USER=xREMAGIx USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

### Triggering deployment with GitHub Actions

:::info

My source repo and deployment repo are the **same** repository.

For more information: [GitHub-Triggering deployment with GitHub Actions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#triggering-deployment-with-github-actions)

1. Create a new file named `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

```yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    # Review gh actions docs if you want to further define triggers, paths, etc
    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: yarn

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Build website
        run: yarn build

      # Popular action to deploy to GitHub Pages:
      # Docs: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-docusaurus
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Build output to publish to the `gh-pages` branch:
          publish_dir: ./build
          # The following lines assign commit authorship to the official
          # GH-Actions bot for deploys to `gh-pages` branch:
          # https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/13#issuecomment-724415212
          # The GH actions bot is used by default if you didn't specify the two fields.
          # You can swap them out with your own user credentials.
          user_name: github-actions[bot]
          user_email: 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
```

2. Create a new file named `.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml` with the following content:

```yml
name: Test deployment

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    # Review gh actions docs if you want to further define triggers, paths, etc
    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on

jobs:
  test-deploy:
    name: Test deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: yarn

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Test build website
        run: yarn build
```

3. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
