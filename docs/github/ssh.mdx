### Generating a new SSH key

1. Open Git Bash.

2. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

3. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

```bash
Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): [Press enter]
```

4. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "[Working with SSH key passphrases](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases)".

```bash
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```

### Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

1. Start the ssh-agent in the background.

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

```
> Agent pid 59566
```

2. If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your `~/.ssh/config` file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.

- First, check to see if your ~/.ssh/config file exists in the default location.

```bash
open ~/.ssh/config
```

```
> The file /Users/YOU/.ssh/config does not exist.
```

- If the file doesn't exist, create the file.

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

- Open your `~/.ssh/config` file, then modify it to contain the following lines.

Open:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Modify:

```bash
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain.

```bash
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH

1. Open Terminal.

2. Change the current working directory to your local project.

3. List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
> origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

4. Change your remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH with the `git remote set-url` command.

```bash

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git

```

5. Verify that the remote URL has changed.

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
# Verify new remote URL
> origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

### Testing your SSH connection

1. Open Terminal.

2. Enter the following:

```bash
ssh -T it@github.com
```

```
> Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
